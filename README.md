#### What is scripting and how is it different to coding/programming?

- Most people think that the two refer to the same thing, but there is a significant difference between them. To put it simply, coding lets you create a program, while scripting lets you control a program that was created with coding. In this article we will take a much deeper look into the difference between code and script, so keep reading.

### What is scripting?

- Scripting is the process of adding functionality to a certain program, or making a program “do something”. We could say that scripting is part of coding. For example, with coding you can make a static website, and then with scripting, you turn that website into a dynamic one. Another thing that scripting can do is automation. For example, you could make a script that sends an automatic text message to all the people who called you, but you didn’t answer the phone. Or, a script that can automatically empty your recycle bin.


### Advantages of scripting

- When scripting, you can perform highly efficient and fast editing with a limited amount of variables and data structures available. Scripting is easy to learn, and you don’t need much knowledge of web technology. Interactivity is necessary for all modern web pages because it helps in adding visualization interfaces. For this reason, scripting is a necessity when it comes to enhancing websites. Finally, scripting provides functionality thanks to different libraries that help in creating new apps.


### Why Python for scripting

- Python is free, open-source, and easy. It supports both object-oriented and procedure-oriented programming. It’s an interpreted language and its lines of code are scripted. Currently, Python is one of the most in-demand programming languages in the world.

### Why is scripting important for Devops Engineer

- DevOps facilitates collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement. So, DevOps engineers must learn specific programming and scripting languages to accelerate improved software releases and deliver them more frequently.

A good DevOps engineer should know several programming or scripting languages. The more coding languages they know, the better they will be at streamlining operations and building software efficiently.
